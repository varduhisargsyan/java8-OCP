 * <p>
 * An enumeration is like a fixed set of constants. In Java, an enum is a class that represents an
 * enumeration. It is much better than a bunch of constants because it provides type‚Äêsafe
 * checking. With numeric or string  constants, you can pass an invalid value and not find out until
 * runtime. With enums, it is impossible to create an invalid enum type without introducing a
 * compiler error.
